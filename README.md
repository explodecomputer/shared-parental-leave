# Parental leave time and money planner

This is the `babytime` R package which attempts to map out

- the financial position for different shared parental leave plans
- working and nursery schedules that occur after shared parental leave, and the financial implications
- how much time each parent will be spending with the baby.

It assumes both parents work at the University of Bristol which implements a shared parental leave policy specified [here](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/hr/policies/shared-parental-leave.html). It's very much a rough implementation that has not been extensively tested. See the vignette for info on how to use it.

## Installation:

```r
remotes::install_github("explodecomputer/shared-parental-leave")
```
